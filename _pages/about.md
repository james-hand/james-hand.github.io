While there he worked on several projects, including the university’s NASA Lunabotics competition team. Following this he received his M.S. in Unmanned and Autonomous Systems Engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU), Daytona Beach, Florida in 2022, with a thesis focused on soft robotics in underwater environments. As part of this degree, he was recognized with the Outstanding Master’s Student award in 2021. Currently he is pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. During his time at ERAU he has worked with the Robotics Association of Embry-Riddle (RAER), working on the club’s NASA Lunabotics team as well as a new project focused on a rocket deliverable robot nicknamed J.I.M.B.O. Related to this he was given the opportunity to work with the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab during spring break 2023. His current research interests include multi-agent systems and how biological analogs can be applied to them. Additionally, robotics in space for exploration and assisting human exploration are of key interest.
